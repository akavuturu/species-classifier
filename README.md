# species-classifier

This side project is an implementation of a convolutional neural network.
The CNN is used to predict the species of an animal from an image - the dataset used is the Animals10 dataset from Kaggle.

The code can be run through the Jupyter Notebook CNN.ipynb. 


## Notes
- The code will create two folders for training data and test data - this code only needs to be run once (it takes a while).
- The current accuracy is only 38%, but this will be improved in future versions. The goal is to reach ~80% accuracy, matching pre-trained CNN performances.
